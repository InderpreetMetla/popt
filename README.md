Pseudospectral OPTimiser (POPT)

This software was developed as part of my undergraduate thesis at The University of Queensland.

This software is able to solve continous time, multiple-phase trajectory optimisation problems 
using Legendre-Gauss-Radau orthogonal collocation methods.

POPT uses IPOPT as its NLP solver. Pre-compiled mex files for MATLAB are required to be obtained from:

IPOPT version 3.11.8 is recommended. The IPOPT mex files are to be placed inside the popt/nlp/ipopt folder.
